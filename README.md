- 👋 Hi, I’m @iflysohigh, goes by the name Ethan Y.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, data analytics, statistics, economic theory and modeling, stock market trends, problem solving and so much more! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Microeconomics, Discrete Structures, Algorithms and Object-Oriented Design. Courses that I plan to take this upcoming school year are Econometrics, Macroeconomics, Statistical Modeling, Automation Formal Language and Computational Complexity, Software Design, and Computational Organizational Architecture. 
- 📚 Relevant Courses I have taken include Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Money and Banking, Imperative Problem Solving, and Applied Statistics.
- ✈️ I have traveled to several Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. The only non-Asian countries I have visited are  Australia and Canada. I have resided in the United States of America for all my life.
- 📖 I’m looking for an internship with an intersection in computer science and economics.
- 🔐 Almost all of my repositories within the GitHub are private, as they pertain to projects performed in classes that could potentially aid current students in such courses. If you would like to have access and are interested (such as for an internship or curiousity), feel free to reach out with the email provided below. The 'personal projects' repository is also private, as it includes code that is original and has not been replicated before. 
- 📫 Contact me at yuenethanw@gmail.com, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks!
