- 👋 Hi, I’m @iflysohigh, formally going by the name Ethan Y.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, data analytics, statistics, economic theory and modeling, stock market trends, problem solving and so much more! 
- ✈️ I have traveled to several Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. I have also visited Australia and Canada. I have resided in the United States of America for all my life.
- 📖 I formerly interned at SMBC within the IT Sector. When I graduate, I look to find an intersection between CS and Finance, preferably a front-office job that incorporates Python programming. 
- 🔐 Almost all of my repositories within the GitHub are private as they pertain to projects performed in classes that could potentially aid students in such courses. The 'personal projects' repository is also private, as it includes code that is original and has not been replicated before (that I know of). If you would like to have access and are interested (such as for an internship or curiousity), feel free to reach out with the email provided below.
