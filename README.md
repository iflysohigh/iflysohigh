- 👋 Hi, I’m @iflysohigh, formally going by the name Ethan Y.
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, data analytics, statistics, economic theory and modeling, stock market trends, problem solving and so much more! 
- 📚 Relevant Courses I have taken include Statistical Modeling, Corporate Finance, Econometrics, Micro/Macroeconomics, Discrete Structures, Analysis of Algorithms, and Object-Oriented Design, Linear Algebra, Differential Equations, Money and Banking, Imperative Problem Solving, and Applied Statistics.
- ✈️ I have traveled to several Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Taiwan. The non-Asian countries I have visited are  Australia and Canada. I have resided in the United States of America for all my life.
- 📖 I am currently an IT intern at SMBC; when I graduate, I look to find an intersection between CS and Finance, preferably a front-office job that includes Python programming. 
- 🔐 Almost all of my repositories within the GitHub are private, as they pertain to projects performed in classes that could potentially aid current students in such courses. If you would like to have access and are interested (such as for an internship or curiousity), feel free to reach out with the email provided below. The 'personal projects' repository is also private, as it includes code that is original and has not been replicated before (that I know of). 
- 📫 Contact me at yuenethanw@gmail.com, and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks!
